This is a simple utility based off Apple's 'SimplePing' that allows one
to check network connectivity. If the blue square is pulsing, the device
is receiving a response to IPv4 ping packets. A red square indicates no
connectivity. 

The plan is to add some very basic statistical information (packet drops,
average response time, etc.) but the idea is to keep the application simple.
